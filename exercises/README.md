# Exercise document overview

In the exercise document you will be lead through different exercises.

## Exercise 1: ETD USER â€“ ETD ROUNDTRIP AND NAVIGATION

In this Exercise you as an ETD User will be able to navigate through the most important UIs of SAP Enterprise Threat Detection. You will get knowledge about different UIs like Monitoring, Alerts, Forensic Lab, Settings, (De-)Pseudonymization, Patterns, Value Lists, etc.

## Exercise 2: SECURITY EXPERT - WORKING WITH THE FORENSIC LAB

The Security Expert sometimes needs to do an ad-hoc analysis about things that happen in the landscape, or he gets a hint about certain suspicious behavior of an IP Address, within an SAP System, of certain program calls etc.
He might need to create own charts to easier interpret the data and the suspicious behavior within, and even he might need to create an own detection patterns to get future alerts about the suspicious actions he found during his analysis.

## Exercise 3: BROWSE, MODEL, AND ATTACK

As a Security Expert you very much have a feeling about anomalies and suspicious behavior within your systems and landscapes, by that if just looking at the data you would already find some presumably critical aspects that you want to explore. The invention of new Patterns based on this knowledge and these findings is the next important step to put your knowledge into automated action. In order to see if your pattern runs in the defined way, you may need to simulate the attack on a Test application, and presumably do a penetration test with Alert Checks.

## Exercise 4: PROCESSING ALERTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

As a Security Analyst in Level 1, 2 or 3 one of your main tasks is to check for raised Alerts and to process them. You need to answer questions like
- Was this a real Alert or a false positive?
- What are evidences which need to be collected to proof the attack or misuse?
- Are there additional Alerts related to this Alert?
Then you may need to collect the evidences and to follow a Standard Operation Procedure for the further actions.

## Exercise 5: PSEUDONYMIZATION OF USER DATA

The users involved in a potential cyberattack are always the most interesting attributes for a Security Analyst. However, all the person-related data must be protected before the collected evidences indicating a real attack. SAP Enterprise Threat Detection replaces the real user ID with User Pseudonym so that no user can be identified during all phases of analysis. Only with very restrictive access right the User Pseudonym can be resolved to real user.

## Exercise 6: MONITORING DASHBOARDS

During the daily operation of security monitoring a Security Agent needs to have an overview of the whole landscape. In ETD they include active alerts, the status of investigations and the log events. Since every agent has his own interested aspect, the content of the monitor must be able to be configured individually. In addition to the security related data he needs also an overview regarding the connected systems, to avoid unnecessary loss or delay of events.
